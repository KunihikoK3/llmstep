# Logics
[Avigad Lean 2022](https://icerm.brown.edu/video_archive/?play=2894)
uses code that is quite similar to the one below.

[Lean 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iub1ULdXjTY&t=501s)
uses the exact code code below. However Avigad's explanation is clearer.

* Get used to be precise about logical connective, phrases like "to prove
  `A ‚àß B` we have to prove `A` and `B`." are awkward but necessary.

Overview of the most important connectives:

‚Üí   \to     if ... then ...           implication
‚àÄ   \all    for all                   universal quantification
‚àÉ   \ex     there exists              existential quantification
¬¨   \not    not                       negation
‚àß   \and    and                       conjunction
‚à®   \or     or                        disjunction
‚Üî   \iff    ... if and only iff ...   biimplication
False       contradiction!            falsity
True        this is trivial           truth

... and how to use them:

            appearing as hypothesis `h`                appearing as goal
`A ‚Üí B`     `have h' := h ha`, `apply h`               `intro ha`
`‚àÄ x, P x`  `have h' := h x`, `apply h`, `specialize`  `intro x`

`A ‚àß B`     `rcases h with ‚ü®ha, hb‚ü©`, `h.1`, `h.2`     `constructor`
`A ‚à® B`     `rcases h with (ha | hb)`                  `left` or `right`
`‚àÉ x. P x`  `rcases h with ‚ü®x, hx‚ü©`                    `constructor` or `use x`

`False`     `contradiction`                            --
`True`      --                                         `trivial`

`¬¨ A`       `contradiction`                            `intro ha`
`A ‚Üî B`     `rcases h with ‚ü®h‚ÇÅ, h‚ÇÇ‚ü©`                   `constructor`

* `by_contra` for proofs by contradiction
* Note that logical connectives can be hidden under other definitions:
  `a ‚à£ b` is existential (there exist k such b=ak), `s ‚äÜ t` is universal (each x in s belongs to t).

## Implication and universal quantifiers
When you define an implication in Lean, such as p ‚Üí q, you are essentially defining a function type. For instance, if you have a theorem or a lemma that states p ‚Üí q, providing a proof for this is equivalent to providing a function that takes an argument of type p (a proof of p) and produces a result of type q (a proof of q).

Let's use the square function as a simple numerical function to illustrate how an implication works as a function type in Lean. We will define a theorem that states an implication involving the square function.
First, let's define the square function:
-/
def square (n : ‚Ñï) : ‚Ñï := n * n
--
#print square
/-
Now, let's state and prove a theorem that uses an implication. We will prove that if a natural number n is greater than 0, then its square is also greater than 0. This is a simple fact since the square of any positive number is positive.
Here's how we can express and prove this theorem in Lean:
-/
theorem square_pos (n : ‚Ñï) : n > 0 ‚Üí square n > 0 :=by
  intro h
  simp only [square]
  exact mul_pos h h
/-
In this proof, the implication n > 0 ‚Üí square n > 0 is treated as a function that takes a proof of n > 0  and produces a proof of square n > 0.

Apparently the intro h tactic in Lean does automatically define h to be the hypothesis of the implication. When you use intro h in the context of proving an implication, it introduces the antecedent of the implication as a hypothesis named h into the local context and shifts the goal to proving the consequent.
-/
theorem my_add_le_add (x y z w : ‚Ñù) (h‚ÇÅ : x ‚â§ y) (h‚ÇÇ : z ‚â§ w) : x + z ‚â§ y + w :=

#print my_add_le_add
section

variable (a b c d : ‚Ñù)
variable (h‚ÇÅ : a ‚â§ b) (h‚ÇÇ : c ‚â§ d)

#check @my_add_le_add
/- When you use #check @my_add_le_add, you are asking Lean to display the type of my_add_le_add with all of its arguments made EXPLICIT, including those that are normally implicit. This could include type class instances or other parameters that the type inference system would normally handle for you.

In Lean, a function or theorem with multiple arguments is often represented as a series of implications when describing its type, especially when those arguments involve proofs or conditions. This is due to a concept called "Currying", where a function of multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions each with a single argument.

Let's break down the output you've provided:

`my_add_le_add : ‚àÄ (x y z w : ‚Ñù), x ‚â§ y ‚Üí z ‚â§ w ‚Üí x + z ‚â§ y + w`

This can be read as follows:

- `‚àÄ (x y z w : ‚Ñù)`: For all `x`, `y`, `z`, `w` that are real numbers (‚Ñù),
- `x ‚â§ y ‚Üí`: if `x` is less than or equal to `y`,
- `z ‚â§ w ‚Üí`: and `z` is less than or equal to `w`,
- `x + z ‚â§ y + w`: then `x + z` is less than or equal to `y + w`.

Each `‚Üí` represents an implication or a functional dependency. The output is essentially saying:

- Given `x` and `y`, if you have a proof of `x ‚â§ y`,
- and given `z` and `w`, if you have a proof of `z ‚â§ w`,
- then you can construct a proof of `x + z ‚â§ y + w`.

It is written in this "curried" form because in type theory and functional programming, a function `f : A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C` is typically a function that takes an argument of type `A` and returns a function of type `B ‚Üí C`. Applied to the theorem:

1. The first implication (`x ‚â§ y ‚Üí`) means that once you provide real numbers `x` and `y`, you need to provide a proof of `x ‚â§ y` to get to the next part of the function.
2. The second implication (`z ‚â§ w ‚Üí`) means that after providing the first proof, you then provide real numbers `z` and `w`, and a proof of `z ‚â§ w` to get the final result.

This curried representation allows partial application. You can provide some of the arguments to `my_add_le_add` and get a function that expects the remaining arguments. This is powerful in proof assistants for building complex proofs step by step.
-/
#check my_add_le_add a b
/- In your theorem my_add_le_add, you defined it with six parameters: x y z w and two hypotheses h‚ÇÅ : x ‚â§ y and h‚ÇÇ : z ‚â§ w. When you pass only two arguments to my_add_le_add, Lean will attempt to match these with the first two parameters x and y.

However, since my_add_le_add expects six arguments (four real numbers and two proofs of inequality), just giving it a and b won't be sufficient for it to be a complete expression or statement. Lean will return the "type" of the partial application of my_add_le_add to a and b, which will effectively be a function type expecting the remaining four arguments.

So, if you execute #check my_add_le_add a b, Lean will display a function type that takes the remaining parameters: two real numbers and two proofs of inequalities, and returns a proof of the inequality a + z ‚â§ b + w (where z and w are the third and fourth real number arguments you'll need to provide, along with their respective inequalities).
-/
#check my_add_le_add a b c d h‚ÇÅ
#check my_add_le_add _ _ _ _ h‚ÇÅ
#check my_add_le_add _ _ _ _ h‚ÇÅ h‚ÇÇ

/- In Lean, an underscore _ is used as a placeholder for an argument whose value can be inferred by the type checker. When you use _ in an expression like #check my_add_le_add _ _ _ _ h‚ÇÅ h‚ÇÇ, you are telling Lean that you want it to automatically fill in these arguments based on the context and the types of h‚ÇÅ and h‚ÇÇ.
-/
theorem my_add_le_add' {x y z w : ‚Ñù} (h‚ÇÅ : x ‚â§ y) (h‚ÇÇ : z ‚â§ w) :
  x + z ‚â§ y + w :=
  add_le_add h‚ÇÅ h‚ÇÇ

/-
In Lean, curly braces {} around parameters in function or theorem definitions indicate that these parameters are implicit. Implicit parameters are automatically inferred by Lean's type checker from the context, meaning that you typically do not need to explicitly provide them when you call the theorem or function. This makes the code more concise and easier to read, especially when the values of these parameters can be straightforwardly deduced from other arguments or the overall context.

{x y z w : ‚Ñù}: The real numbers x, y, z, and w are implicit arguments. This means when you use my_add_le_add', you do not need to explicitly provide x, y, z, and w if Lean can infer their values from h‚ÇÅ and h‚ÇÇ.

(h‚ÇÅ : x ‚â§ y), (h‚ÇÇ : z ‚â§ w): These are explicit arguments. You must provide proofs of these inequalities when you call my_add_le_add'.

The existential quantifier in Lena comes with an axiom called *global choice*.
It provides a witness for all proofs of existentially quantified statements and
guarantees that the witness is the same if we deconstruct the same statement twice.

noncomputable def chooseNat (h : ‚àÉ (x : ‚Ñï), x > 4) : ‚Ñï := by
  exact Exists.choose h
/-!
In the context of Lean, the term "noncomputable" is used to indicate that a definition or function cannot be computed algorithmically within the Lean proof assistant's framework. This typically occurs when the definition relies on axioms or principles that do not allow for constructive computation, such as the axiom of choice or the law of excluded middle.

The specific Lean code snippet you provided:

```lean
noncomputable def chooseNat (h : ‚àÉ (x : ‚Ñï), x > 4) : ‚Ñï := by
  exact Exists.choose h
```

Here's a breakdown of what each part means:

 **noncomputable**: This keyword is used to mark the definition as noncomputable. In Lean, certain operations or definitions that depend on non-constructive axioms (like the axiom of choice) must be explicitly marked as noncomputable. This is because Lean, by default, operates under a computationally constructive framework where every function or operation should ideally be computable.

**by exact Exists.choose h**:  `Exists.choose` is a function in Lean that, given a proof of an existential quantifier (in this case, `h`), returns a witness satisfying the existential statement. Here, it returns some natural number `x` such that `x > 4`. The `exact` tactic is used to specify that `Exists.choose h` directly provides the value that `chooseNat` should return.

The use of `noncomputable` is crucial here because `Exists.choose` relies on the axiom of choice, which asserts that for any nonempty set, one can choose an element from the set without specifying a particular rule for making the choice. In constructive mathematics, which Lean's kernel is based on, such an axiom is not generally accepted because it does not constructively provide the element. Thus, any definition relying on this axiom must be marked as noncomputable to signal that it cannot be computed purely algorithmically within Lean's constructive framework.

## Negation

`¬¨ A` is an abbreviation for `A ‚Üí False`.
In propositional logic, an implication $A \implies B$ is true in all cases except where \(A\) is true and \(B\) is false. If we set \(B\) as \(\text{false}\), the implication \(A \implies \text{false}\) translates to a situation where \(A\) must be false for the implication to hold true, because there is no case where \(A\) can be true (since the outcome would then be false, which contradicts the implication being true). This is precisely the definition of \(\neg A\), which asserts that \(A\) is false.

  /-  push_neg is a tactic that simplifies negations within expressions, particularly useful for working with logical statements.

  -/
  assumption
/- "assumption" refers to a tactic used within the proof environment to utilize a hypothesis that matches the current goal, thereby proving it directly. When the assumption tactic is invoked, Lean checks the context for a hypothesis that can directly conclude the proof of the current goal. If such a hypothesis exists, the goal is considered proven by that assumption.
